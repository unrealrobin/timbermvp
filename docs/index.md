# Die Robot – Game Systems Portfolio

**Die Robot** is a 3rd-person tower-defense/action game I built solo in **Unreal Engine 5.4 (C++)**.  
Players defend a lab from waves of robots by building traps, chaining trap combos, and fighting directly with weapons and weapon abilities..

This portfolio highlights the **three core gameplay systems** I’m most proud of.
