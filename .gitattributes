#Notes:
#Asset Files: Unreal Engine asset files (.uasset, .umap) are typically large and are best managed with Git LFS.

#Graphics Files: Common image formats, model files, and Adobe files are included.

#Audio and Video Files: Common audio and video formats are tracked to handle potentially large file sizes.

#Animation Files: Animation-specific formats like .anim (for custom animation files) are included.

#Other Binaries: Generic binary formats are also tracked.

#Exclusions: Theres a commented-out example for excluding certain file types from LFS tracking. You can uncomment and adjust it to fit your needs.

#Customization:
#Tailor to Your Project: Depending on the specific assets and file types your project uses, you may need to add or remove entries.

#Initial Setup: Remember to set up this .gitattributes file before adding large files to ensure theyre correctly managed by Git LFS.

#Git LFS Initialization: Ensure that Git LFS is initialized in your repository (git lfs install) before you start adding files.

#This .gitattributes file should provide a good starting point for most basic Unreal Engine 5 game projects, ensuring that large files are efficiently managed and version-controlled with Git LFS.
